/**
 * Description: MarketPriceHandlerImpl contains the main subscription logic. Its functional dependencies are
 * FXPriceFeed for incoming prices, MarginManager for margins, PriceCache for storing latest pricess and
 * MarketPriceHandler.Listener for the rest server. A 5th dependency is the executor service for providing
 * concurrency with the incoming price feed thread.  Incoming prices can then be queued in the SingleThreadExecutor
 * as shown below. The margined price is published on a simple Listener which is directed toward the rest server.
 * For this the AsyncRestServerPriceListener will batch these for efficient publication to the rest Server on a
 * scheduled interval.
 * <p>
 * Assumptions:
 * 1) Incoming price thread should not be blocked or used for anything but queueing the incoming price;
 * 2) Outgoing publication to the rest server is potientially a slow consumer of prices
 * 3) Client direct access to latest price is coming in on a separate thread.
 * 4) Unit tests should test on a single thread
 * 5) This is a push design, a price pull design would require a refactoring
